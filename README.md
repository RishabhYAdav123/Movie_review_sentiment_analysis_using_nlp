ðŸŽ¬ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment. It involves text preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF, embeddings), and machine learning models like Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, or deep learning (LSTM, BERT).

ðŸš€ Features
Text Processing (tokenization, stopword removal)
ML/DL Models for sentiment classification
Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, F1-score)
Dataset: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes
ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack
Python, NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Flask/FastAPI (optional for deployment)
ðŸ“‚ Usage
Clone repo & install dependencies
Train the model (train.py)
Predict sentiment (predict.py --review "Sample review")
Future improvements include BERT/GPT models and web app deployment. ðŸš€
